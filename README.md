# Discord Bot
 
This repository is for our Discord Bot, the main purpose being "to learn OOP and some real life API uses".

The bot is currently part of a class group and will be used for greet and can answer a little bit of common questions.

I've started with python, using discord lib. In coming days as we progress we wil work with other API's and frameworks as well.
